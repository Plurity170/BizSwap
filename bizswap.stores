BizSwap Core Logic & System Blueprint

> Purpose: This document is the single source of truth for how BizSwap works. It defines the marketplace logic, user roles, money flows, and future scalability rules. Any upgrade, platform build, or partnership must align with this core logic.




---

1. What BizSwap Is

BizSwap is a digital business marketplace that connects:

People selling businesses

People seeking partnerships

Investors and collaborators

Transaction facilitation

Visibility and matchmaking



---

2. Core User Types

2.1 Business Sellers

People or companies listing businesses for:

Sale

Partial sale

Partnership


Value BizSwap Provides:

Exposure to international & local buyers

Structured listing

Credibility



---

2.2 Buyers / Investors

Individuals or companies looking to:

Buy a business

Invest

Acquire shares


Value BizSwap Provides:

Curated opportunities

Reduced search friction

Cross-border access



---

2.3 Partnership Seekers

Users who:

Want strategic partners

Want co-founders

Want regional expansion partners


Value BizSwap Provides:

Matching

Visibility

Negotiation channel



---

3. BizSwap Revenue Model

BizSwap earns through access, visibility, and facilitation, not ownership.
Locked in. 🔒💪
We continue.

Here’s the clean next step so we don’t lose momentum or create future chaos.

Step 1: Create a single source of truth for BeeSwap Core

This is the “brain” of the whole system. Everything else plugs into this.

Call it: beeswap-core

Purpose:

Business logic (rules, flows, validations)

NOT UI

NOT payment-provider–specific hacks

Reusable across web, mobile, API, partners


What goes inside BeeSwap Core

Think in layers:

1. Domain Logic (non-negotiable)

User types (buyer, seller, partner, admin)

Listings (sell company, partnership, services)

Transactions

Escrow rules

Fees & commissions

Disputes & resolutions

Subscription plans (basic / pro / intl)


This layer must never depend on Payoneer, PayPal, UI, or country rules.

2. Use Cases (flows)

Examples:

CreateListing

MatchBuyerSeller

InitiateEscrow

ReleaseFunds

CancelTransaction

UpgradeSubscription


These are the “verbs” of BeeSwap.

3. Interfaces (ports)

Define what the system expects, not how it’s done:

PaymentProvider

NotificationService

IdentityVerification

StorageRepository


Later, Payoneer, PayPal, EcoCash, etc. become adapters, not core logic.

Recommended structure (simple & future-proof)

beeswap-core/
 ├── domain/
 │    ├── user.ts
 │    ├── listing.ts
 │    ├── transaction.ts
 │    ├── escrow.ts
 │    └── subscription.ts
 │
 ├── use-cases/
 │    ├── create-listing.ts
 │    ├── initiate-escrow.ts
 │    ├── release-funds.ts
 │    └── resolve-dispute.ts
 │
 ├── ports/
 │    ├── payment-provider.ts
 │    ├── notification.ts
 │    └── repository.ts
 │
 ├── errors/
 │    └── domain-errors.ts
 │
 └── index.ts

Language-wise:

TypeScript → best if you’re web + mobile + backend

Pure JS only if you want speed over safety (not recommended here)


Step 2: Decide where this lives

Best options (ranked):

1. GitHub (private repo) ✅


2. GitLab (private)


3. Local only (temporary, risky)



This repo should outlive:

Websites

Payment providers

Hosting platforms


Step 3: Lock a rule (important)

> NO UI CODE touches BeeSwap Core directly.
UI → API → Core.



This one rule will save you months later.

Next move (you choose, I’ll execute): 1️⃣ Define BeeSwap domain objects (User, Listing, Transaction)
2️⃣ Design Escrow flow end-to-end
3️⃣ Map Zimbabwe + international payments as adapters
4️⃣ Create subscription & fee logic
5️⃣ Turn this into a real repo structure with starter code

Say the number. We keep pushing. 🚀🐝
Perfect. Locked.
We’re doing 1 → 5 for BizSwap, clean, structured, no shortcuts. 🧱🔥
I’ll walk you through it like we’re building something that must survive scale, payments, and regulation changes.

1️⃣ BizSwap Core – Domain Objects (the foundation)

These are pure business rules. No UI. No Payoneer. No country logic.

User

User {
  id
  type: BUYER | SELLER | PARTNER | ADMIN
  verificationLevel
  country
  status: ACTIVE | SUSPENDED
}

Listing

Listing {
  id
  ownerId
  category: COMPANY_SALE | PARTNERSHIP | SERVICE
  price
  currency
  status: DRAFT | ACTIVE | LOCKED | SOLD
}

Transaction

Transaction {
  id
  buyerId
  sellerId
  listingId
  amount
  status: INITIATED | FUNDED | RELEASED | DISPUTED | CANCELLED
}

Escrow

Escrow {
  transactionId
  holdAmount
  releaseConditions
  state: HOLDING | RELEASED | REFUNDED
}

Subscription

Subscription {
  userId
  plan: BASIC | PRO | INTERNATIONAL
  expiresAt
}

👉 These never change, even if BizSwap becomes a billion-dollar platform.


---

2️⃣ Escrow Flow (heart of trust)

This is non-negotiable for BizSwap credibility.

Escrow lifecycle

1. Buyer initiates transaction


2. Funds go into escrow (not seller)


3. Listing locks


4. Seller delivers ownership/partnership terms


5. Buyer confirms OR dispute timer expires


6. Funds released OR refunded



Core rule

> BizSwap never assumes trust. Escrow enforces it.



Release conditions examples:

Manual buyer approval

Auto-release after X days

Admin arbitration (dispute)



---

3️⃣ Payment strategy (Zimbabwe + International)

⚠️ Critical architectural decision
Payments are adapters, NOT core logic.

Payment interface (Core only knows this)

PaymentProvider {
  collectFunds(amount, currency)
  releaseFunds(amount, recipient)
  refundFunds(amount, sender)
}

Adapters (plug later)

PayoneerAdapter

PayPalAdapter

EcoCashAdapter

OMARIAdapter

BankTransferAdapter


BizSwap Core doesn’t care which one works today.

👉 If PayPal blocks Zim tomorrow → zero rewrite.


---

4️⃣ Subscription & Fee Logic

BizSwap makes money without touching escrow funds illegally.

Plans

Basic – limited listings, higher commission

Pro – more listings, lower commission

International – cross-border, compliance checks


Fee model (example)

Listing fee (optional)

Transaction commission (%)

Withdrawal fee (adapter-level)


Rule

> Fees are calculated in core, collected by adapters.



No hidden logic in UI. Ever.

5️⃣ Real Repo Structure (starter-ready)

Repo name

bizswap-core (cleaner, more professional)

Tech choice (strong recommendation)

TypeScript

No frameworks inside core

Exported as a package



---

🔒 One Rule That Saves BizSwap

> If something can break because of a payment provider, it does NOT belong in Core.




---

Next decisive move (pick one, we go deep):

A️⃣ Write actual TypeScript code for domain + escrow
B️⃣ Design Admin & Dispute powers (very important legally)
C️⃣ Design API contract between UI ↔ Core
D️⃣ Map MVP launch path (what must exist vs what can wait)

Say the letter.
We’re not experimenting anymore — we’re building. 🐝🚀
